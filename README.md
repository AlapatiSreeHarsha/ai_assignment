# Yoga Pose Correction App
Aligned is a yoga pose correction web application that uses computer vision and deep learning to process videos of a userâ€™s yoga poses and provides feedback on how to improve the pose. The app was built using Flask and runs on an Amazon EC2 instance with GPU.

## How does it work?

* User logs in and selects which pose to evaluate
* App provides instructions on how to execute the pose
Once ready, the user records a video of themselves doing the pose within the app (using webcam)
Video is automatically processed using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), an open-source, deep learning-based library for keypoint detection developed at Carnegie Mellon University.
* The app uses the keypoints from OpenPose as features to classify different pose faults using a rule-based algorithm.
* Feedback is provided to the user on how they can safely improve their pose.

<i> Note that the app's website is not currently available due to the high cost of running AWS EC2 instance.</i>
